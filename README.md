Salesforce Integration Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on integrating Salesforce with an external system to achieve real-time data push and nightly data sync, ensuring data hygiene and avoiding duplicates. The integration is implemented using only Salesforce platform technologies (Apex, Platform Events, and Scheduled Jobs), without relying on third-party iPaaS solutions.

🛠️ Problem Statement

The business has purchased a new system that must be integrated with Salesforce to:
✔ Push data in real-time from Salesforce to the external system.
✔ Pull data nightly from the external system back into Salesforce.
✔ Maintain data integrity, avoiding duplicates and conflicts.

📌 Requirements

🔹 Functional Requirements

✅ Real-time data push from Salesforce to the external system using Apex Callouts or Platform Events.
✅ Nightly data pull from the external system into Salesforce via Scheduled Batch Apex.
✅ Data hygiene and deduplication to ensure accurate, conflict-free synchronization.

🔹 Technical Constraints

⚙ Salesforce-Only Integration – No iPaaS (e.g., MuleSoft, Boomi, Workato).
⚙ Direct API Communication – The external system must support HTTP-based API with authentication.
⚙ No Proprietary/Sensitive Data – The external system must allow free account access for development.

📡 Chosen External System: Monday.com

We selected Monday.com as the external system for this integration because:
✔ It supports RESTful API for pushing and pulling data.
✔ Free developer accounts are available.
✔ It requires authentication via API keys for secure access.
✔ It allows task management, which aligns well with Salesforce use cases.

🚀 Solution Architecture

🔹 Real-Time Data Push (Salesforce → Monday.com)

✔ Trigger-based Apex Callout to send data to Monday.com API upon record changes.
✔ Platform Events for scalability (optional, if multiple systems need to listen).
✔ Future Methods or Queueable Apex to handle async processing and limits.

🔹 Nightly Data Pull (Monday.com → Salesforce)

✔ Scheduled Apex Job to fetch data every night.
✔ Batch Apex to process large datasets efficiently.
✔ Upsert with External ID (Monday_Task_id__c) to prevent duplicate records.

🔹 Data Hygiene & Deduplication

✔ External ID Fields in Salesforce to uniquely map records.
✔ Duplicate Rules & Matching Rules for conflict resolution.
✔ Field-Level Validations to maintain data integrity.

📜 Implementation Details

1️⃣ Setup & Authentication
	•	Generate Monday.com API Key for authentication.
	•	Store credentials securely using Salesforce Named Credentials.

2️⃣ Salesforce → Monday.com (Real-Time Push)
	•	Apex trigger on Monday_Task__c calls Apex Callout to create/update tasks in Monday.com.
	•	Handles retry logic for failures.

3️⃣ Monday.com → Salesforce (Nightly Pull)
	•	Scheduled Apex fetches task updates every night.
	•	Batch Apex processes large datasets and upserts records.
	•	Uses External ID (Monday_Task_id__c) to avoid duplicates.

✅ Key Features

✔ Uses only Salesforce platform technologies (Apex, Triggers, Batch Jobs).
✔ Asynchronous processing for scalability.
✔ Error handling & logging for failed API calls.
✔ Secure authentication with Named Credentials.
✔ Deduplication and data integrity via External IDs.

📌 How to Deploy & Test

1️⃣ Deploy Code to Salesforce

Use Salesforce CLI or deploy via Metadata API.

2️⃣ Configure Named Credentials
	•	Set up Named Credentials in Salesforce for Monday.com API.

3️⃣ Run Test Classes

Execute all test cases to validate the integration:

RunAllTests --namespace=""

4️⃣ Activate Scheduled Job for Nightly Sync

Run in Anonymous Apex:

System.schedule('Nightly Monday Sync', '0 0 2 * * ?', new MondayTaskScheduler());
