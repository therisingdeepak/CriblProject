/**
 * The MondayTaskBatch class implements the Database.Batchable interface
 * to perform batch processing on Monday_Task__c objects.
 * 
 * This batch class is designed to query all records from the Monday_Task__c
 * object and process them in batches. The actual processing logic is intended
 * to be implemented in the execute method
 * 
 * The batch process consists of three methods:
 * - start: Defines the query to retrieve the records to be processed.
 * - execute: Processes each batch of records.
 * - finish: Executes any post-processing logic after all batches have been processed.
 * 
 * This class can be scheduled to run at specific intervals to ensure that
 * Monday_Task__c records are kept in sync with an external system.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * Database.executeBatch(new MondayTaskBatch());
 * 
 * Note: The actual synchronization logic with the external system (e.g., Monday.com)
 * should be implemented in the execute method.
